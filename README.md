# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The project required designing a system to manage course data efficiently, allowing users to load courses from a file, display a sorted list, and retrieve course details, including prerequisites.
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store and manage course data efficiently. Understanding data structures was crucial for selecting the right one based on search, insertion, and sorting efficiency. The BST ensured fast lookups and maintained a natural sorted order.
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One challenge was handling file input and parsing course data correctly. I resolved this by using stringstream to process each line and extract course details properly. Debugging involved checking edge cases, such as courses with no prerequisites.
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project reinforced the importance of selecting the right data structure based on efficiency and use case requirements. It also helped me improve modular programming by breaking the system into smaller, reusable functions.
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I improved code readability by using clear function names and consistent formatting. Maintainability was enhanced by encapsulating BST operations in a class. The system is also adaptable, as I could extend it with features like a self-balancing BST for improved performance.
